# Inter-Kingdom Equestrian Competition

In this repo you will find HTML files for all of the scores in the database.

I used a package called [HTTrack](https://github.com/xroche/httrack) to do this and made the current mirror on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 10:29:07 GMT.

## Goals

This will allow interested parties to host a mirror by cloning the repo into their web host.

## TODO

Make small edits throughout to various places in the HTML files and tree for better portabillity.
